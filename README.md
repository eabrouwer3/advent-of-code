## What I do

Every year I want to do Advent of Code and the past couple of years I've even actually started it, but I've never actually finished
all 25 days. I usually do a few days and call it good. But it's kind of a perfect opportunity for me to try out a new language that
I haven't ever used. Here's the languages I've used in the past:

 - 2023: Solidity
 - 2022: Rust
 - 2021: Clojure
 - 2020: Deno
